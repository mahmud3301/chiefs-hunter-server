In a separate bowl, whisk together egg yolks and sugar until well combined. 4. Slowly pour the hot cream mixture into the egg yolk mixture, whisking constantly. 5. Strain the custard mixture to remove any lumps. 6. Divide the custard among ramekins or oven-safe dishes. 7. Place the ramekins in a baking dish and fill the dish with hot water halfway up the sides of the ramekins. 8. Carefully transfer the baking dish to the preheated oven. 9. Bake for about 30-35 minutes or until the custard is set around the edges but still slightly jiggly in the center. 10. Remove the ramekins from the water bath and let them cool to room temperature. 11. Refrigerate the custards for at least 2 hours or overnight to chill and set completely. 12. Just before serving, sprinkle a thin and even layer of granulated sugar over each custard. 13. Use a kitchen torch to caramelize the sugar until golden and bubbly. 14. Allow the sugar to harden for a few minutes before serving.",
